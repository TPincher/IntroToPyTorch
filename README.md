# IntroToPyTorch

This is following a YT tutorial from Codemy.com, available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY14KfZQ1TI&list=PLCC34OHNcOtpcgR9LEYSdi9r7XIbpkpK1&index=2).

The tutorial series progresses through an introduction to PyTorch - syntax, tensors, operations and file manipulation - and then works through creating a simple neural network with the iris database, and a convoluted neural network with the MNIST database.
